## Usage example

**Important: Update to the latest firmware (>= v3.0) on your eye tracker before using this!**

If you want to try this with your eye tracker without writing code, it is recommended to use the Skyle.proto file with [BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc).
It is an open-source GUI Client for gRPC services, that instantly works with the provided proto file.

_For detailed usage, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/eyev-de/Skyle.proto/wiki)._
